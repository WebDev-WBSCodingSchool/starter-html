# From concept to deployment — Git/GitHub

Two days. Group project, presentation at the end. It is the first thing you build
as a team, and it is a website: semantic HTML, hand-written CSS, live on GitHub
Pages when you are done.

This repo is your starting point. **Fork it once for your group** and add your team
members as collaborators — one fork, everyone works in it, every change merges to
`main` through a Pull Request.

**The design is yours, and there are two ways to get one.** Take the barebones
Figma wireframe and make it your own, or pick a site you like from
[frontendpractice.com](https://www.frontendpractice.com) and rebuild its look.
Clone something that exists or let your creativity reign free — both are real
projects, and neither changes a word of what follows. Decide it in the first hour,
together, and write it in `PLAN.md` so nobody is still designing on day two.

## Where you are

Five stages. Each one says what ends it, because that is the part nobody can see
from inside it.

1. **Fork it, clone it, run `/onboard`.** Ends when the only thing the check still
   objects to is `PLAN.md` — that one is stage 2, and it stays red until you get
   there. Everything above it should be a tick.
2. **Meet, and write `PLAN.md` together.** Ends when the check is green: every
   member listed has a task line, and your own git email is one of them. Until
   then the agent writes no code for anyone in the group.
3. **Pick a task, cut a branch.** `git switch -c <task-id>-<short-name>`. Ends when
   you have somewhere to put the work that is not `main`.
4. **Write it, commit it, explain it.** Ends when it is committed. Nothing opens
   up on this project — the HTML and the CSS are yours for both days — but tell
   the agent you are done with a piece and it will ask you how it works.
5. **Open a Pull Request.** Ends when it is merged. Then back to 3 with the next
   task.

## The requirements

| | what it is |
| --- | --- |
| **FR001** | **The page itself** — the doctype, a head carrying the title, the character encoding, the viewport and your stylesheet, and the body everything lives in. |
| **FR002** | **Header and navigation** — the top of the page, and how someone gets from here to your other sections or pages. |
| **FR003** | **The content sections** — the middle of the page: whatever your design has, built out of elements that say what each part *is*. |
| **FR004** | **Footer** — the bottom, belonging to the page rather than to the section above it. |
| **FR005** | **Images and media** — with alt text that says what the picture shows, and dimensions so the page does not jump while it loads. |
| **FR006** | **The layout** — where the boxes go, built with flexbox and grid. |
| **FR007** | **The look of it** — colour, typography, spacing, borders, and what happens on hover and on keyboard focus. |
| **FR008** | **Every change to `main` arrives through a Pull Request** that a teammate reviewed. No direct pushes, not even for a typo. |
| **FR009** | **The site is live on GitHub Pages**, and the link is on the repo's front page. |
| **FR010** | *Stretch:* **responsive.** Desktop first; if you have time, make it work on a phone. |

**Bold = you type this one yourself, and here that is all of it.** Every
requirement above that produces HTML or CSS is yours, both days. Nothing unlocks
part-way through — write and explain the header and the agent still will not write
your footer. It stays that way until the project is over.

FR008 and FR009 are bold for a different reason: they are not code, so there is
nothing for anyone to type on your behalf. They are also the two most likely to be
left until the last afternoon. Do FR009 on day one, with an empty page — a
deployment that works before there is anything to deploy is worth an hour of your
last evening.

## The setup

This project is plain HTML and CSS files, served exactly as they are — GitHub Pages
puts your `index.html` on the web with no build step in between, and any teammate
can clone the repo and open it in a browser with nothing to install. Keep it that
way: **no `npm install`, no Tailwind or Bootstrap, no preprocessor** — the CSS is
yours, written by hand. Google Fonts and an icon set like Font Awesome are fine,
linked in your `<head>`, and that is the shape of the only exception: if you end up
wanting something else external, it comes from a CDN as a `<link>` or `<script>`
tag, late, as the last cherry on top. Anything that has to be *installed* before
the site runs stops every teammate's clone working until they have run the same
setup you did — in the middle of a two-day project where nobody has time to debug
somebody else's toolchain.

You start with `index.html` and `css/style.css`. More pages, or more stylesheets
(extra `<link>` tags, or `@import` at the top of this one), are yours to add if you
want them. Nothing has to be installed, and nothing here is generated.

## What you type, and what the agent types

**Two topics, and between them they are the entire site: semantic HTML and CSS.**
The elements you choose and the structure they make; the layout you build with
flexbox and grid; the colour, the type, the spacing, the hover and focus states.
That is what this module is for, so that is what you type — every tag and every
rule, both days. The agent will not write markup or stylesheet rules for you: not
one element, not three lines "just to get you started", not by putting them in the
chat for you to copy across. That is not it being difficult with you. You have two
days to build a thing your hands know how to do, and there is no version of that
where something else does the typing.

**Everything else the agent can write, from day one:**

- **Git — and on this project that is the big one.** Five people and two files
  means merge conflicts; that is not a mistake anyone made, it is what the workflow
  is for. Ask it to walk you through the loop until it is muscle memory: branch,
  commit, update `main`, merge `main` into your branch, push, open the PR, merge it
  on GitHub. Ask it *before* you do anything that feels like it might lose work —
  that is the moment it is most useful. When you do hit a conflict it will show you
  what each side does and which markers to delete; **you** type the resolution,
  because untangling one is the thing you are here to learn and it takes ten
  minutes the second time.
- **Everything around the site.** GitHub Pages setup, the repo's front page, the
  `.gitignore`, how to word an issue or a PR description. It advises; you write
  your own issues and your own reviews.
- **Reading your code back to you.** What is wrong with it and why, why that
  element rather than the one you picked, why the layout collapses at that width.
  It will tell you what to change. You change it.
- **Words, in the chat.** If you are stuck on how a paragraph should be phrased,
  ask — it can suggest wording, and you type what you like into the page. And if
  the text is not the point yet, lorem ipsum is a perfectly good answer.
- **Anything you want to understand**, including things this project does not use.
  JavaScript, frameworks, build tools, what a bundler is. Asking is free and the
  answer is not a detour.

**If you brought a different agent** — Codex, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, Pi, whatever
you have running — read `AGENTS.md`, which is the same rule written for it. Only
Claude Code is actually held to it by hooks; every other tool is on the honour
system, so if yours reads some other instructions file, point it at `AGENTS.md`
yourself.

**The agent waits to be asked.** It will not start building because a file is empty
or because your plan is finished — none of this is a to-do list it works through on
its own. Ask it for what you want, and expect it to ask you back when there is
something to decide.

Yes, this tells you exactly what you could paste into a browser chat instead. You
are being told the rule rather than fenced in by it, because a rule you can read is
one you can decide to keep.

## Write it, commit it, explain it

When you have written one of the tasks marked in bold above:

```
1. Write it.
2. Commit it.   git add <your file> && git commit --signoff -m "<task id>: <what it does>"
3. Explain it.  The agent asks what your commit does, then a few short questions.
```

**Step 3 is the one worth having.** Explaining code you have just written is how
you find out whether you understood it, and it works the same whether anyone is
listening or not. Expect one question about what your commit does and up to three
short follow-ups: more for a big commit, fewer for a small one. Nothing is graded
and nothing you say is written down — the commit ahead of it in the history is
already the record of who wrote what.

**Nothing changes afterwards, and that is the point here.** Step 3 earns you no
help: the HTML and the CSS stay yours whether you explain them or not. Say "I'm
done with the navbar" and the agent will read your commit and ask you about it —
say no and it drops the subject. Ask for it again a day later and it will do it
then. It is a mirror, not a gate, and it is the cheapest way to find out that you
know why you wrote something.

When the project is finished and committed, one person runs
`node .claude/hooks/signoff.mjs --done`. That records the exercise as finished and
opens the gated set — which by then only matters for anything you want to build on
top of what you wrote.

### Signing your commits

`git commit --signoff` adds one line to the commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Lea Müller <lea.mueller@example.com>
```

It means **I wrote this code**. It is an ordinary git trailer — you will meet it in
real projects. Nothing here checks it, and it is worth doing anyway.

Use it on your own work throughout the project, not only on the tasks marked in
bold. When the agent wrote or helped write something, the commit carries a
`Co-Authored-By: Claude …` line instead, which it adds itself. Between the two,
`git log` shows who wrote what — which is more use to all of you than trying to
remember in week three.

## Before any of that: `PLAN.md`

**The agent writes no code for anyone in the group until `PLAN.md` exists and
every member listed in it has at least one task.** Meet first — one call, one
screen shared — and write it together.

Two halves. First, a short restatement **in your own words**: what you are
building, who uses it, and how much of it you are actually going to build — which
parts of the design are in, and which you are leaving out on purpose. That last
one is where two of you find out you pictured different amounts of work, so write
down what you land on.

Then the split. Everyone's **git email** — the address `git config user.email`
prints — and each of you again on the task you took:

```markdown
## Who's in the group
- Jane Student — jane.student@mail.com
- Mo Ahmadi — mo.ahmadi@mail.com

## The split
- Login page (T1) — Jane
- Settings page (T2) — Mo Ahmadi
```

That is the whole format. A list, a table, prose, German, English — it does not
care. Each of you has to turn up twice: once in the member list with your **git**
email, and again on the task you took. On the task line your name is enough — the
address is only needed once, because that is what your progress is filed under.

Run `/onboard` and the agent will run the conversation, name the parts nobody has
claimed and the places two of you will collide, and check the file. **It will not write a word of it** — `PLAN.md` is what the
check reads, so an agent that could write it could clear its own way.

**The check is live.** Edit `PLAN.md` so that someone has no task and the agent
stops writing code for everyone until the line is fixed. There is nothing to
re-run: it reads the file again on the next write. That is the accountability
part, and it is meant to be visible rather than clever. If someone has actually
left the group, take them off the member list — that is the right answer, not a
slight.

A sketch is enough and it is allowed to change. The question is whether you have a
plan, never whether it was any good.

## Splitting the work

`PLAN.md` is the kickoff snapshot. **From then on your tasks are GitHub Issues on
your fork** — `/onboard` can create them from your task lines, or make them by
hand; the issues are the live version and nothing syncs them back.

Write them yourselves either way — the agent will not hand you a breakdown. Once
you have a draft it will tell you if the load looks lopsided, if something is
blocked on two other people, or if two of you are about to land in the same
function.

That last one will happen, and you can see it coming from here: for the first day
this whole project is `index.html` and `css/style.css`, so every one of you is
working in the same two files, and the header someone is styling sits three lines
above the section someone else is writing. Resolve them together; that is the
point.

Ask for help if you are stuck for more than 30 minutes. Have a stand-up on the
morning of day two, even though it is only two days — especially because it is only
two days.

## Running it

Open **this folder** in VS Code and start Claude Code from the repo root. Starting
it from a subfolder silently drops this folder's settings, which mostly means the
agent starts writing code it should be helping you write.

Your progress is filed under your git email, so set it once and use the same one
on every machine you work from — otherwise the work you did in the lab and the
work you did at home end up in two separate records, and neither counts for the
other.

**If you want the agent to talk differently** — simpler language, shorter answers,
more or less detail — say so, and ask it to save that as a personal skill in
`~/.claude/skills/`. It travels with you to the next project, so you only have to
ask once. It changes how the agent talks, not what it may write.

Inline suggestions (Copilot-style ghost text) are turned off for this folder in
`.vscode/settings.json`. That file is read-only, and the agent cannot write to it
at all — otherwise it could hand ghost text back in a single edit, and ghost text
is the one form of help that arrives without being asked for.

**This file is read-only too**, along with `CLAUDE.md`. This page is the
requirements: it is what the agent reads to work out what it may write for you and
what it may only talk you through, so it is not a page the agent gets to reword.
`PLAN.md` is read-only to the agent as well, for a different reason: it is yours,
and it is what the check reads. Your own writing about your project goes in files
you make — `PLAN.md`, your Issues, whatever else you want.

If you think a requirement is wrong or unclear, say so to your instructor. That is
a conversation, not a diff.

None of these locks is a cage, and you should know that up front: read-only here
means VS Code refuses the keystroke, and there is a setting that turns that off, and
there are other editors. What none of it can do is happen quietly. Every file named
above is committed, so however you go about changing one, it lands in your PR with
your name on it. That is the whole mechanism — not "you can't", but "it's visible".
